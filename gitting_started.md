# Getting started with git

[Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install git and create a GitHub account.<br>
We will use git and GitHub to manage and version control our work.

* Git is a version control software that manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of that project. It's the most popular version control system, and can help us manage project files -- especially important when working in teams. Git is a tool you install on your computer.
* [GitHub](github.com) provides a nice visual interface to help you manage your version-controlled projects locally.

# Tutorials
1. First tutorial [here](https://github.com/etjernst/Materials/blob/master/git/git_tutorial_1.md). 
> Replace `git clone https://github.com/etjernst/fertilizer_markets.git` <br>
> with `git clone https://github.com/etjernst/MediaMotivation.git`<br>
> ...and obviously the subsequent `cd fertilizer_markets` is instead `cd MediaMotivation`
2. [Second tutorial](https://github.com/etjernst/Materials/blob/master/git/git_tutorial_2.md) on branches. 
> We should do our work in branches to avoid conflicts if we are working simultaneously. <br>
> In fact once we get code up here I think I should protect the master branch.<br>
> We can use pull requests to merge in updates from branches.<br>
> We should still pull and push from our branches regularly.
3. I will make a tutorial on pull requests as well but they are super easy from the GitHub interface.
